# Not a Hotdog
App clone from HBO's Silicon Valley.

The app is made with react native and uses Googles Vision API to identify images.

The idea was taken from https://dev.to/amanhimself/build-a-not-hotdog-clone-with-react-native-367 but I did some modifications.

## 1)Install the app
```bash
Yarn install
```

## 2)Run expo
```bash
Yarn start
```
